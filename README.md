# Human Activity Recognition

### üìù Description
This project is made with a perspective of recognizing human activities.  
The human activity recognition model was trained on the **Kinetics 400 Dataset**.

To learn more about the dataset and model:
- Kay et al.‚Äôs 2017 paper: [The Kinetics Human Action Video Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06950)
- Hara et al.‚Äôs 2018 CVPR paper: [Can Spatiotemporal 3D CNNs Retrace the History of 2D CNNs and ImageNet?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09577)

The authors ‚Äî Kensho Hara, Hirokatsu Kataoka, and Yutaka Satoh ‚Äî explained how existing 2D CNN architectures (like ResNet, ResNeXt, DenseNet) can be extended to video classification via **3D kernels**.

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

#### Required
- Python Programming Language
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) basics

#### Recommended (not mandatory)
- [ONNX-Based Deep Learning Models](https://github.com/onnx/models)
- [OpenCV for Python](https://opencv.org/)

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installations
- [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Install OpenCV for Windows](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d5/de5/tutorial_py_setup_in_windows.html)
- [Install OpenCV for Ubuntu](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d2/de6/tutorial_py_setup_in_ubuntu.html)
- Execute:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy

###  Directory Structure:

### External Download:
-You need to dowwload a resnet-34_kinetics.onnx model from here and once downloaded drop it inside the model directory of our project (shown in directory structure)

### Setup:
1.I have added a video example for testing in test directory
2.If you want to test your own video file be sure to add it in test folder
3.Now, inside recognise_human_activity.py constructor set instance variable VIDEO_PATH to you file path.
4.Otherwise, if you want test the model on using web-camera live video just set self.VIDEO_PATH = None

-Once your setup is done run the following to execute code:
```bash
python recognise_human_activity.py
```
